        At Kawawii Island, the activities are endless! Except for this page. We
        are dilligently working on media production for each activity, along
        with copious amounts of annoying ads to play while you're watching your
        YouTube videos! For now, please enjoy this video made by our wonderful
        tour guides! (Sean has since been let go due to his distasteful
        comments):
